  expect(screen.queryByRole('button')).toBeAccessibleButton()
})
```

:::info This project does not guarantee what you build is accessible.

The GDS Accessibility team found that **only ~30% of issues are found by automated testing.** This
tool may help you identify common issues but cannot guarantee what you build works for users.

You'll also need to test your interface with the assistive technologies that real users use.
